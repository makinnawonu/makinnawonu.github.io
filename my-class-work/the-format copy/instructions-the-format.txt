FORMAT THE FORMAT

Instructions: 

While our tribute page for The Format looks amaaazing in the browser, the accompanying code in index.html and style.css is messy as HECK! Please help fix the following: 

- indentation (making sure to be consistent in using either tabs or spaces)
- line breaks (at the right spots, without extra empty lines)
- spacing (color:red; vs color: red)
- capitalization (H1 vs h1, etc)

BONUS: We have some some inline CSS in index.html. That's (usually) not the best, so let's move it next its stylish friends in style.css.

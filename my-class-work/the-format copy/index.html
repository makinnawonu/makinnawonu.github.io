	<h1>The Format</h1>


	<p><span>The Format</span> were an indie rock band formed in 2002 by Nate Ruess and Sam Means in Peoria, Arizona. Their style incorporated elements of 1960s and 1970s pop. The Format broke up in 2008, with Nate Ruess going on to front the far more commerically successful band Fun!.</p>
